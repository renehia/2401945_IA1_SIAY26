  <h2>Reflection on Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn & Chris Widener</h2>

  <h3>Chapter 4 – Achieve Your Goals</h3>
  <p>
    This chapter reflects that success begins with setting specific goals. It is emphasized in the chapter that goals give life direction and meaning. Without them, a person just lives without purpose. 
    The authors explain that goals should be written down, measurable, and regularly reviewed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Application to My Life:</strong> I learned that to reach my dream of becoming a professional 
    software developer and expanding my hair business into a full brand, I need to set structured goals and track my progress. For example, I plan to complete my degree at UTech with a 3.8-4.0 GPA
    and learn at least two new programming languages by the end of my second year.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter 5 – The Proper Use of Time</h3>
  <p>
    The authors remind us that time is life’s most valuable resource, and how we use it determines 
    our future so it should be ujsed wisely. They explain that successful people value their time to build habits 
    that move them closer toward their goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Application to My Life:</strong> This chapter inspired me to really look into how I use my time. I will try to manage my time better by balancing 
    school and work. Instead of wasting hours on Tik Tok and Instagram or playing games, I plan to schedule 
    study sessions and practice coding consistently, using planners or reminder apps to stay organized with my business.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter 6 – Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
  <p>
    This chapter shows us that personal growth depends on the people we associate ourselves with.
    Jim Rohn states that we become the average of the five people we spend the most time with. 
    Positive, disciplined, and successful people influence us to grow, while negative people 
    can hold us back.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Application to My Life:</strong> I realized that I need to bond with more people who 
    motivate me to do better academically and spiritually. I plan to connect with classmates who 
    are focused and hardworking.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter 7 – Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
  <p>
    Here, the authors stress that there is always room for continuous learning and self-improvement. 
    They argue that education should not end after school, and that personal growth comes from reading, 
    observing, and applying new knowledge. It is good to learn something new daily.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Application to My Life:</strong> This motivated me to be more open minded when it come on to learning, whether through 
    formal education or studying on my own. I plan to read books, attend all my classes and watch videos
    that will improve my coding skills. As I continue to grow, I also want to help 
    others by sharing what I learn.
